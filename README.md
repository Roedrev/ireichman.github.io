# Portfolio website.
## Why?
This website serves two purposes. To begin with, it is my first fullstack development project. 
But the real purpose of it is to serve as testing subject QA automation frameworks I am working on.

### The working.
This website started as a static page on GitHub.
It now uses:
* next.js
* React
* Written in TypeScript.
* Texts hosted in a .TS file. Will be moved to a DB.
* The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com)

### The future.
* SQL database for hosting assets.
* A fake store for QA demo purposes.
